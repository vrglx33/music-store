## The Problem

### Artists Lack Direct-to-Fan Revenue Channels
Independent artists struggle to sell their music directly to fans without relying on streaming platforms that pay minimal royalties or marketplaces that take significant revenue cuts. This results in artists receiving only a fraction of what consumers pay for their music.

**Our Solution:** We provide a low-fee marketplace where artists retain maximum control and revenue from their music sales, while providing buyers direct access to purchase from creators they want to support.

### Fragmented Music Discovery and Purchase Experience
Music buyers face a disjointed experience when trying to discover independent artists and purchase their music, often navigating multiple platforms with inconsistent interfaces and payment systems.

**Our Solution:** We offer a unified platform with intuitive browsing, seamless cart-based purchasing, and standardized high-quality music delivery.

## Differentiators

### Artist-First Revenue Model
Unlike Spotify or Apple Music which pay fractions of cents per stream, we enable artists to set their own prices and keep the majority of revenue from each sale. This results in artists earning 10-100x more per transaction compared to streaming platforms.

### Direct Artist-to-Fan Connection
Unlike traditional music stores that aggregate content from labels, we provide artists with their own portal to manage their catalog, pricing, and releases. This results in faster releases, direct fan engagement, and complete creative control.

### Curated Independent Music Experience
Unlike general e-commerce platforms, we specialize exclusively in music, providing genre-based discovery, album artwork showcase, and music-specific metadata. This results in a superior browsing experience tailored specifically for music discovery and collection.
